#
# Turns this template repo into a real gitops-cluster-<name> repo: reads cluster.yaml
# (copy cluster.yaml.example first, see that file's own header), validates it,
# deletes whichever optional component directories weren't selected, and substitutes
# this template's own literal identity strings (repo name, cluster name, Infisical
# project slug) with the new cluster's real values throughout every remaining file.
#
# Same conventions as platform-cicd/hack/bootstrap-upper-cluster.sh and
# hack/generate-cluster-values.sh: require()/log()/warn() helpers, refuses rather
# than guesses on ambiguous or invalid input, idempotent is NOT claimed here (unlike
# those two) — this script is meant to run exactly once, against a fresh clone of
# this template, never against an already-customized repo. Re-running it against a
# repo it already customized will not find its own source literals anymore and is a
# no-op at best, a source of confusing partial-double-substitution at worst if you've
# since introduced a real reference to "kind-dev" or "gitops-cluster-dev" of your own
# (e.g. a cross-cluster relay URL comment). Re-clone the template for a second cluster
# instead of reusing a customized checkout.
#
# See idp/docs/cluster-provisioning.md for the full design.

1. Review the diff, then commit + push this repo as a new GitHub repo named
   ${CLUSTER_REPO_NAME}.

2. Open a PR against gitops-cluster-dev adding
   00-bootstrap/cluster-registry/${CLUSTER_NAME}.yaml:

     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
       namespace: crossplane-system
       labels:
         platform.io/cluster-registry: "true"
     data:
       type: ${TYPE}
       cicdReady: "false"
       crossplaneReady: "false"
       tenantsRepo: ${TENANTS_REPO}

   Flip cicdReady/crossplaneReady to "true" only after live-verifying each
   (idp/docs/service-catalog-design.md §0) — this registry entry is what every
   NodeJSApplication.spec.devCluster / ApplicationEnvironment.spec.cluster gate reads.
   The registry is centralized on kind-dev by design (the only place it's read from);
   this script does not push to that repo itself.

$( [ "${INFISICAL_HOST}" = "true" ] && echo "3. Create infisical-secrets / infisical-bootstrap-credentials by hand before 10-crds-operators/infisical/application.yaml's first sync — see that file's own header for the exact kubectl create secret commands. Never paste these into chat." )
$( [ "${PLATFORM_CICD}" = "true" ] && echo "4. Run platform-cicd/hack/generate-cluster-values.sh ${CLUSTER_NAME} ${CLUSTER_NAME} 50-platform-cicd/platform-cicd-control-plane/ against the real cluster (once it exists) to produce values-${CLUSTER_NAME}.yaml — this repo deliberately does not vendor another cluster's Fulcio/CA material (ADR-0006)." )

5. Run the real cluster bootstrap sequence (kind create cluster / Calico / apply
   01-argocd-platform/install.yaml --server-side / restore argocd-repo-creds-* /
   apply root-app-of-apps.yaml) — see this repo's own README.md, which mirrors
